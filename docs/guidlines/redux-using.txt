STEPS to define, register reducer:
1. Define action into 'src/app/actions'
2. Define reducer into 'src/app/reducers'

## common reducers -  using for all screen pages
3. Add reducer to 'commonReducers' into 'src/app/reducers/index.js'

## screen page reducers - using for only this screen page
3. Define 'Route' with 'routeRender' function from 'src/app/app.routing.js'


USING dispatch action into template/component/page:

1. Define map stored state to this template properites, ex: 'src/app/shared/components/header.component.js' with 'mapStateToProps' fucntion.
2. Connect this component/page with store instance, ex: 'src/app/shared/components/header.component.js'
